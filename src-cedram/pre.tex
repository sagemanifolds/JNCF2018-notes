\section*{Preface}
These notes correspond to two lectures given by one of us (EG)
at \emph{Journées Nationales de Calcul Formel 2018}  (French Computer Algebra Days),
which took place at Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques (CIRM),
in Marseille, France, on 22-26 January 2018.
The slides, demo
notebooks and videos of the lectures are available at

EG warmly thanks Marc Mezzarobba and the organizers of JNCF 2018 for their
invitation and the perfect organization of the lectures. He also acknowledges
the great hospitality of CIRM and many fruitful exchanges with the conference
participants. We are very grateful to Travis Scrimshaw for his help in the
writing of these notes, especially for providing a customized \LaTeX{} environment
to display Jupyter notebook cells.
